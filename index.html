					Hunger can affect anyone. Food insecurity has always been a pressing issue in the United States. According to Feeding America, in 2019, there were 35,207,000 million food insecure people in the country. In New York that same year, there were 2,090,550 million food insecure people, which is just roughly 5.94% of all food insecure people in the United States. Two years later, we experienced the coronavirus pandemic and food access became even more limited. Throughout the pandemic, brightly painted fridges started to randomly pop up on the street. These are free-food community fridges. They are basically sturdy-functioning fridges placed outside of local businesses that are filled with donated food.

					<p class="information">
						Free-food community fridges’ are implemented to combat food insecurity while also helping reduce food waste. It is an anonymous way to get and provide food, promoting a “take what you need, give what you can” motto. A community fridge's resources are based on the need and availability of food, services, or supplies within a community.

					<p class="information">
						A great majority of Americans throw out most of their food every day. Yet, millions of people in this country don’t know where their next meal will come from. During the pandemic, grocery stores had a multitude of empty shelves due to the high demand of products, many restaurants closed with no word of reopening, and 1/3 of New York’s food pantries, soup kitchens, and mobile pantries had to close.

					<p class="heading"> The Impact in New York City </p>

					<p class="information">
						Even though the city’s food services were working on helping those in need, New Yorkers took matters into their own hands. Throughout the boroughs, fridges were plugged into apartment buildings, bodegas, and other local businesses. Some even have accompanying pantries to store the non-perishable goods. There are currently a total of 148 community fridges in New York.

					<p class="information">
						Community fridges are much more than charity or interesting sidewalk art. It’s a way for communities to get together and help each other out. Many who volunteer to maintain their community fridge, believe that there is no need to waste or throw away food if you can utilize the fridge and help another family in need. The goal is a sense of community empowerment.
